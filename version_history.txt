*= important item

Version 3.4.8
	corrected msgbox option when saving HTML results folder (it asked if you wanted to overwrite an existing folder.. but did so regardless of the answer)
	made sure that "n/a" was added to the hcp time column as well as adj time column. this corrected a fault with autowinners.
	finally, found an removed an obscure bug which created problems if user input into datagrids co-incided with an input of times/crews.

Version 3.4.7(Beta)
*	Fixed Save As error introduced in 3.4.6 (due to the underscore character in the menu!)
	manual data entry auto minute/ autohour made more powerful.
	
Version 3.4.6(Beta)
	Menu extended to give more user options without cluttering up the UI (it's cluttered enough!!)
*	ClubTable wizard added - allows auto scratching of crews etc....
	offsettimes accessed by menu - users complained about the radio select (for start..split1 etc) not being intuitive.
*	manual entry wizard added for start,split1,split2,finish. (for entering backup data - or even standalone??)
	
Version 3.4.5
*	altered the way results are presented. I have separated "Penalties" and "Handicaps". Overall position takes only penalties into account.
	added a boat class sort.	
	csv files added to HTML output
*	stopped sorting categories by alphabetical order. For now just take the order from the crew table. I think this should work better, and gives the user _some_ control over the order of crews in the output. 
However I may still work on this??
	minor error that menu items still work when a tab is locked - cleared this for now.
*	coded for "overall position", ie 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th= etc.. 	

Version 3.4.4
	Added a version history (what you're reading!!)
*	Improved the method of event handling for f1,f2,f3 and f4 keys to record timing events - this also freed up resources to improve the processing speed of the program.
	Handicap tab renamed "Veterans" and made functional 
*	HTML output changed to a folder containing a separate javascript file and stylesheet.
*	Added a form to check CSV file input. (Suggestion - David Marsh, Wallingord RC)

Version 3.4.3
	Set up a separate tab for "wizards"
*	Improved file open/save. - this now works in a more standard fashion.
	New startup form - now just a picture.
*	Allow file registration, such that a double click on a rot file took you straight into it.
	Unchecked all boxes on import tab after an import.

Version 3.4.0 released October 2006
	Improved HTML output to include a stylesheet and a Javascript "ruler"
*	Corrected int 16 error with Category sorting of very large events.
