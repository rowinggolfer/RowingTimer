		<h2>Crew Tab</h2>
		This very important tab is where you load up the data for your crews.
		<br />This is either done 
		<ul>
		<li>
		Manually <i>(Click "Add Row" and get typing!)</i> or 
		</li>
		<li>or from Disk (Comma Separated files generated by Excel)
		</li>
		<li> or from rowtimer files (which have the extension *.rot)
		</li>
		</ul>
		There are some rules though. <br />
		Bow Numbers must be positive integers (1 - 1000) with no duplicates .<br />					
		When entering "Club" and "Category" be wary that for sorting the results <i>case</i>  and spacing are important.<br />
		For example "M NOVICE 8+", "M Novice 8+", "M Nov 8+", "MNov 8+" are all different!  
					<br />
		Handicaps and Penaltied are values in<B> 'seconds'</B>. A handicap of 1 minute and 9 seconds should be added as 69.
					<br />
		Also use this tab (at any time) to remove crews who don't start the race and for any disqualifications.<br />
