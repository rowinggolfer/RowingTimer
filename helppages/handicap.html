		<h2>Handicap Tab</h2>
Veteran handicapping is an odd issue.<br />
Under most current regimes, the size of handicaps applied varies with the <i>duration</i> of the event. <br />
Handicaps are applied retrospectively, based on the fastest "Veteran A" or "Open" crew of the day.<br />
<br />
To my thinking this is imprecise. If Leander entered a typical Scottish Head Race, for instance, 
would handicaps come tumbling down right accross the board?<br />
The higher categories would benefit from this... or put another way... are penalised whever an truly elite crew doesn't race.
<br />
<br />
When I find the correct formulae and/or tables, this tab is where you will apply them in future versions of rowing timer.<br />
