Here is where I hope anyone who remains unimpressed will alter their viewpoint.<br />

You have three options for outputting your results.<br />
<ul>
<li>
1. You can copy the results table to Excel, using the windows clipboard.
You will see three extra columns... these are the numerical values I have used to sort by club, 
category and "adj time". <br />
<i>But why would you want to do this when you have two better options........
</i> 
</li>
<li>
2. Save an HTML version of your results. An example is <a href="example_results.html"> Here</a>.
</li>
<li>
3. Or preview and print them out immediately.<br />
Rowing timer automatically formats such that all columns fit to the width of a page.<br />
It chooses the largest font which will fit.<br />
As a result, choosing a paper setting of "landscape" will give you a bigger display. <br />
</li>
</ul>
