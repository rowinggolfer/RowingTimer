		Here you are presented with a few options.<br />
These will undoubtably swell as the program develops further.<br />
<br />
A few options deserve an explanation.
<ul>
<li>
"allow full edit and sort".<br />
When this is active, you can use keyboard entry in all the major cells. Including "Time" values.<br />
</li>
<li>
"Autowinner" should normally be checked.<br />
This scans the results for the fastest in each category. 
</li>
<li>
Files offered at startup. <br />
For our head races, I make sure these are links to Division one and Division two rot files.<br />
</li>
 </ul>
