		<h2>Import</h2>
When you save a rowing timer file - it saves everything. Times - Crew names, handicaps, penalties the lot.
<br />
However, you may not wish to reload all of this data. <br />
<br />

So when you import, you can either "check all" and load the entire file, or load selectively. <br />
This is useful if you use more than one PC for any one event, (where you load start from one, and split1 from another) .<br />
Or perhaps if your same set of crews race frequently. (Open last the same file, but only the crew information)<br />
 
<br />
The other button on this page allows import from excel - click<a href="excel.html"> HERE </a> for details.
