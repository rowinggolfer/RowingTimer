		<h2>FAQS</h2>
<ul>
<li><h3>How do I merge the results collected by more than one PC?</h3>
<i>This is how we use the program in Inverness. Start Times are collected on one PC, and the event is saved as "start.rot" 
On the PC we have been using at the finish, we open the rowing time import tab and check "Start Data".. then click on the load button.<br />
And that's it!</i>

<li><h3>Can I use something other than a PC to record some of my times?</h3>
<i> I am working on a Pocket PC application to do just this. The times collected could be loaded into Rowing Timer.<br />
 A smartphone application is also a neat idea.<br />
Both these have better battery power than a laptop, and are obviously far more convenient.<br />
All we need is a two dimensional array and the ability to save a text file.<br />
Time as a string (HH:mm:ss.ff) mapped to a column of integers (Bow Numbers).<br />
I would invite any budding developers to get onto this. <br />
The user interface is the main problem - how do you allow for a "whoops I didn't mean to click that" button?<br ?
