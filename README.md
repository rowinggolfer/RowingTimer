# RowingTimer
A timer for head races formally used by the Inverness Rowing Club in Scotland.

A website explaining what this is about, and where installers can be found is
archived at https://static.rowinggolfer.org/rowing-timer-software .


This was my first proper coding project, and the code is a disgrace.
I put it our here, warts and all, as good people have stated an urge to
ressurect the project.

The language is Visual Basic (VB.net) and was compiled using Visual Studio.

The last editing / compilation of this project was 17th February 2007!

Good luck to anyone who wishes to fork this.
