		<h1>Rowing Timer - Description and Help</h1>
		Thankyou for trying and using Rowing Timer.<br />
		This software is freeware, please distribute freely.<br />
		I hope you will find it to be a flexible and useful piece of software for 
		timing of processional head races.<br />
		<br />
		Though still a work in progress, I believe that as it stands, it works OK. I 
		tested it at a 180 boat head race in Inverness on Saturday 20th, with just one 
		computer, and mobile phones along the course.
		<br />
		<br />
		Most of what the program does should be self-explanatory. In common with usual 
		procedures for this type of race, all times are measured from an arbitrary 
		"Synchronisation point". By default I have set this to be when the first crew 
		button is pressed. It can, however be set well in advance, or changed at any 
		time (in which case any recorded times are rolled back). I recommend you use 
		this facility to synchronise a backup timer (eg. wristwatch or coaches 
		stopwatch).<br />
		<br />
		There are 2 basic ways to use the program.
		<ul>
			<li>
				1. A single computer with the operator getting input from observers along the 
				course (mobile phones/radios etc..).
			</li>
			<li>
				2. Multiple computers at points along the course.... and the data from each 
				collected into a spreadsheet for sorting.<br />
				This is advisable if you still have crews starting as earlier crews are 
				arriving at subsequent timing points, otherwise your clicking can get a bit 
				frantic! Obviously, in this case ensure you "synchronise" these computers at 
				some point (afterwards is OK provided you haven't exited the program on 
				either).<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				3. Any other combination of the above!
			</li>
		</ul>
		Below is a brief description of the three user interface forms that are 
		generated, along with a few notes on the more advanced and hidden features.
		<br />
		I hope this covers everything. Do let me know of any problems, and I would be 
		delighted to get feedback of any type.<br />
		<br />
		It is my intention to make a commercial version of this program, with greater 
		functionality of this program to allow for better accuracy, printing of 
		results, immediate application of Veteran handicaps etc.
		<br />
		This would not be freeware, but licensed for a £10 donation to Inverness Rowing 
		Club.<br />
		If you would like to be informed how this is developing, or contirubute with 
		ideas and suggestions, <a href="mailto:rowingtimer@invernessrowingclub.co.uk">Send 
			me an email.</a>
		<br />
		<br />
		Thankyou for your time!<br />

					<h3>Start Form.</h3>
					This is the main form for the program, and is the control for all the others. 
					Consequently if you exit this form, you shut all others and leave the program. 
					I have, therefore, protected it with an "Are you Sure?" question.<br />
					<br />
					Regardless, when you do exit, all information generated is transferred on your 
					clipboard (more on this later).<br />
					<br />
					When using the program, the first thing you should do is adjust the minimum and 
					maximum crew numbers to suit the event (or division) that you are timing. 
					Defaults are 1 and 50 respectively, but I have allowed and tested the program 
					for up to 500 crews!<br />
					Crew buttons can be added or removed at any time.<br />
					The check boxes (and stopwatch menu) will make the "watches" appear and 
					disappear. There are 4 watches available to you.... Start, Split 1, Split 2, 
					and Finish.<br />
					You may decide to use them all, or maybe just one or two.
					<br />
					The watches keep running and updating in the background, and you can open and 
					close these at will.
					<br />
					I have defaulted the watches to appear in a grid along the top. With a desktop 
					of over 1024 wide this works well. You can, of course, move the forms around. 
					However, should you wish to realign them then at any time, there is a menu 
					option on the startform to "align to grid".
					<br />
					<br />
					Like the watches, the Results form and eventlog can be opened and hidden at any 
					time.

					<h3>Stopwatch Form</h3>
					This form has shows the time elapsed since synchronisation.
					<br />
					<br />
					It has a collection of numbered buttons. These relate to the crew numbers you 
					entered initially.<br />
					If you have more than 50 crews, a scroll bar will appear to allow easy 
					navigation.<br />
					<br />
					click on a crew button as the crew arrives at the relevant point. The time is 
					recorded in the relevant column, and the button becomes inactive.<br />
					<br />
					One other button is on the stopwatch forms. It is "PANIC button" A click on 
					this button records adds a new line of data to the results, and records a time 
					in the relevant column.<br />
					It is obviously hoped that you are able to identify a crew and click on the 
					correct button swiftly, but this provides an alternative should a bow number be 
					unclear or its value unexpected for whatever reason. When you add a time to the 
					results in this way, you will need to make a note of why and manually adjust 
					the results later.<br />

					Crew 5 lost their bow number, so the "PANIC! button" was used at the finish 
					point. (this button can be used at any time to record a time). If you have 
					three crews crossing a point together it is the easiest way of recording times 
					close together.
					<br />
					As they were the only unknown result, this was easily altered in excel, along 
					with a comment from the Umpire<br />
